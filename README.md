linux-distributions:

--->distribution is simply a collection of software and applications bundled,together and distributed as a single operating system. For example, one Linux


---.>Distribution shortened to distro. Also, some people refer to the various
distributions as flavors. 

--->What every Linux distribution has in common,
	though, is the Linux kernel. Again, typically when the term Linux is used it refers to the
	Linux Operating System as a whole.

--->However, it can refer to just the Linux Kernel as well. 

--->The Linux kernel is the
	core or the heart of the Operating System. It’s the layer that sits between
	the hardware and applications. 

--->Said another way, it’s the intermediary
	between software and hardware.

# About SSH

--->If you're going to connect to a Linux system over the network,
	more than likely you're going to use SSH.

## SSH stands for Secure Shell.

### SSH is a network protocol.

It's primary purpose is to allow you to connect,
from one system to another system, 
## "securely over a network".




----> In order to connect to Linux over the network,we're going to need a terminal emulator,that also acts as an SSH 	client.

---->For windows, the most popular SSH client and terminal emulator,
	is a program called, PuTTY.



# Terminal Emulator

------> A terminal emulator allows a host computer to access another computer, including remote ones, through either a command-line interface or a graphical one. The communication is made possible using protocols such as Telnet and SSH.
